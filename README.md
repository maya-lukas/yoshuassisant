## Configuration Tab

A new configuration tab has been added to allow users to input their own embed links (e.g., Coda, Notion) dynamically.

### How to Use:
1. Navigate to the Configuration section in the app.
2. Enter your desired embed link in the input field.
3. Click the "Update Iframe" button to display the content in the iframe.

This feature enhances the interactivity of the application by allowing users to customize the displayed content based on their needs.

## Advanced Configuration Options

For advanced users, additional configuration options are available to further customize the application's behavior. These options can be accessed by clicking the "Advanced" button in the Configuration section.
